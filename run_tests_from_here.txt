run test from this level

python -m unittest fsap.test.file_test

if error is something along the lines of "AttributeError: 'module' object has no
attribute 'sp_test'" --> go check the module refereces in the test file and any
files that the test file is referencing. it is a shitty, undescriptive error
that is less than help
